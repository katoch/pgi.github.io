Well, obviously nothing of this ever happened. :)

The [Venue](/#venue) is magnificent as you 'll witness yourself firsthand when you join
us in Athens. Everything is going as planned.

We still have lots of work to do before we're ready to welcome you to Athens
this June for EuRuKo 2013, however we are getting there.
Our [CFP is open](/blog/2013-03-28-call-for-presentations/)
and [a lot of proposals have been submitted](http://cfp.euruko2013.org/proposals) already.
We suggest you get a look at them and vote for those you like and make
suggestions to improve the ones you feel need a more thorough description.
And why not read the process and [submit your own proposal](http://cfp.euruko2013.org/about)?

Really soon, we will announce the [first batch of tickets](/#tickets).

Stay tuned and follow us closely on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/euruko), our [blog feed](/blog/feed.xml) and our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/w3D21).

Just to reassure you here are a couple more images from the [EuRuKo 2013](/) awesome Venue:
