[Anynines](http://www.anynines.com/?utm_source=euruko&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=selene)
is an upcoming Heroku-like PaaS written in Ruby. A hosting that grows with your
apps!

Folks from Anynines see their job as terribly important - many developers put pet apps
to PaaS providers, yet introducing larger installations is often way too expensive and
complicated. That’s why it’s going to start as non-freemium, pay-as-you-go service.
Additionaly, one of Anynines’ goals is to make PaaS both affordable and compliant to
European privacy laws.

As you see, it’s more than just business. Anynines supports selected non-profit open source
and charity projects with free hosting, being itself based on the CloudFoundry software!
This will allow a fair cost-by-cause-based pricing while still returning something to the
community. A sort of Fair Trade hosting.

Anynines is operated by [enterprise-rails.com](http://www.enterprise-rails.com/?utm_source=euruko&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=selene), a Rails-focused hosting service and a
division of Avarteq. Enterprise-rails.com manages and runs your app in any environment -
most customers simply leave the job up to to Enterprise Rails, including hardware and/or
OpenStack virtualization, Chef installation automation, monitoring and backups.
Just leave it to them and enjoy your apps running like a clockwork.

The engine behind Anynines is [Avarteq](http://www.avarteq.de/?utm_source=euruko&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=selene), a German Ruby shop
founded in late 2008. It’s been many projects since then and Avarteq has grown from 3 to
over 30 people, becoming a rock solid organization with profound Ruby and Ruby on Rails
knowledge for both development and operations.

Anynines loves EuRuKo and would do all their best to keep this magical event alive.
