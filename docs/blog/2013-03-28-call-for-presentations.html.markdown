We are very excited to announce that Call for Presentations for EuRuKo 2013 [is now open](http://cfp.euruko2013.org/proposals)
and you can send your proposals until **April 23rd**! We have put a lot of effort in order to create a selection process
that will encourage submissions by everyone irrespective of publicity, gender, race, domain, etc,
guarantee a high quality conference and at the same time be fun for all participants.
The process has been refined with feedback from the community and all the details can be found [here](http://cfp.euruko2013.org/about).

So mark the dates and get engaged:
- Submit your proposal! We are pretty sure that almost everyone has something interesting to share!
- Help refine the proposals: comment, suggest, criticise and show your love :)
- Spread the news to the proper channels: your local ruby user groups, your blog, your circles!

...and one last thing: you know how hard it is to find a ticket for EuRuKo usually, right?
They tend to sell out in seconds. Well, this year, we are reserving a priority line for active participants
in the CfP process along some other goodies that may come later.

So, what are you waiting for? [Join the party](http://cfp.euruko2013.org)!
