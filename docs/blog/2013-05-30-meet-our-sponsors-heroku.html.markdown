[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/?utm_source=euruko&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=selene) (pronounced her-OH-koo) is a multi-language cloud application platform - a new way of building and deploying web apps. They are proud to have two keynote speakers at EuRuKo 2013: Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto and Koichi Sasada, both Ruby(CRuby/MRI) core developers, where they will show the newest Ruby world - more useful, effective and faster.

Heroku's platform-as-a-service allows your organization to build faster, deploy instantly and scale on demand without managing servers. Gain the flexibility to deploy any language any time and to any scale. Maintain control by isolating, running and monitoring independent processes. Heroku makes it effortless.

Heroku recently announced the opening of a Europe region. After collaborating closely with customers during private beta, Heroku services are now available to all customers in Europe as part of a public beta. The Heroku Europe region runs applications from data centers located in Europe, offering improved performance for users in that region.
