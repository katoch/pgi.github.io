As you can see from the images below the venue of this year's EuRuKo,
Badminton Theatre, is being renovated. To be honest, we knew such works were
planned, yet we chose to book this amazing [venue](/#venue) because it was impressive,
and with the recently planned renovation it would be really awesome. It was a
bold and risky move due to the recent economic difficulties Greece is facing
right now (including workers' strikes). What we wanted, was to have the greatest and
biggest venue [EuRuKo](http://euruko2013.org) had ever seen.

We were promised that the venue would be ready by April, yet when we went there
earlier today to inspect the premises we where dumbfounded to discover that the
works are midway, with an estimate of late August finish at best!

The organising committee, along with all of our the amazing volunteers and venue
construction crews are working hard to help with construction works. However, we
can't make any promises yet. We will inform you of our progress as we approach
the June deadline. In the mean time [follow us on twitter](http://twitter.com/euruko)

The committee promises to pull its sleeves up and dive into hard work with the shovel
in order to organize EuRuKo 2013 on time.

Thank you for your support.
